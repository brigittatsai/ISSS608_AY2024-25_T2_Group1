# üìã Minutes of Meeting 1

## üóìÔ∏è Meeting Details

-   **Meeting Title:** Project Meeting for Exploring Different Topics and Datasets
-   **Date:** Tuesday, 4th March 2025 and Friday, 7th March 2025
-   **Time:** 04:00 PM to 05:30 PM and 09:00 PM to 10:00 PM
-   **Attendees:** Brigitta Karen Tsai, Enrico Limberg, Hannah

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìù Meetings' Objectives

The objective of our meetings was to review the available topics and identify a suitable problem statement for our project, ensuring that the necessary data is accessible to support our chosen direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìã Meeting Agenda:

1.  Review of Available Topics
2.  Assessment of Data Availability
3.  Formulation of Problem Statement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Review of Available Topics

### Discussions:

-   **Brigitta**: Examined the first topic, **PISA 2022**, and determined it was not a suitable choice due to:
    -   The complexity and extensiveness of the dataset, primarily questionnaire-based.
    -   The high level of data manipulation and preprocessing required.\
        ‚Üí **Task:** **Brigitta** to document key challenges and findings.\
        ‚Üí **Conclusion:** The team decided to drop this topic.
-   **Enrico & Hannah**: Explored the second topic, **Be Weatherwise or Otherwise**, and found challenges due to:
    -   Data being too scattered (recorded on a monthly basis), making it hard to analyze long-term trends.
    -   Climate trends being influenced by multiple external factors not fully captured in the dataset.\
        ‚Üí **Task:** **Enrico and Hannah** to summarize the data gaps and challenges.\
        ‚Üí **Conclusion:** The team agreed not to drop this topic yet but will attempt to address the data gaps and challenges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Assessment of Data Availability

-   **Brigitta & Hannah**: Explored two potential extensions, **‚ÄúImpact of Climate Change on Carbon Emissions‚Äù** and **‚ÄúImpact of Carbon Emissions on Climate Change.‚Äù** Both extensions faced data fragmentation issues and lack of comprehensive datasets.

-   **Brigitta & Hannah** expressed concerns that the **Be Weatherwise** topic would be overwhelming due to the need for large datasets.

-   **Enrico** provided a different perspective. He suggested that instead of analyzing all areas, the team could focus on specific key areas based on available data such as:

    -   Dengue fever
    -   Coastal areas
    -   Flood-prone regions\
        ‚Üí This approach would narrow the scope and make the project more manageable, despite the fragmentation in the available datasets.\
        ‚Üí **Task:** **Enrico** to explore how to refine the focus based on specific areas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Formulation of Problem Statement

-   **Brigitta & Hannah**: Investigated the impact of **Changi‚Äôs weather data** on flight arrivals and departures.

-   However, **Brigitta, Enrico and Hannah** realized it was too much to collect all the flight data, leading to a reconsideration of the topic.

-   **Enrico** explored the impact of:

    -   Rain intensity in specific Singapore areas on rising sea levels (coastal impact analysis)
    -   Dengue fever outbreaks (potential mosquito breeding correlations)
    -   Rising temperatures and urban heat island effects.

-   **Brigitta** then questioned how to identify the areas with the highest dengue cases.

    -   **Enrico** suggested analyzing dengue fever cases first, then selecting the area for further data collection.
    -   **Brigitta** reviewed available dengue data sources but only found records from 2014 to 2018.
    -   **Hannah** verified the fact that there is no more recent data on dengue.

-   **Brigitta and Enrico** researched flood-prone areas in Singapore to refine the focus.

-   The team decided to focus only on:

    -   Rising temperatures
    -   Rising sea levels
    -   Flood risks\
        ‚Üí **Enrico** drafted the initial problem statement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps:

### Follow-up Meeting:

-   **Date:** 13th March 2025
-   **Time:** 4:00 PM
-   **Objective:** Review progress, share findings, and finalize next steps based on new data collected.

### Agenda:

1.  **Review of Data Collection Progress**
    -   **Brigitta & Hannah**: Share findings from continued search for datasets on temperature rise and flood risks.
    -   **Enrico**: Present research findings from news sources and climate-related papers on climate changes in Singapore.
2.  **Discussion of New Data and Information**
    -   Team to evaluate the newly gathered data and information.
    -   Analyze the relevance and quality of datasets for the project.
3.  **Finalize Next Steps**
    -   Identify any additional data collection needs.
    -   Outline actions for the next phase of the project based on current findings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

During the meetings on **4th and 7th March 2025**, the team reviewed various topics and datasets. The **PISA 2022** dataset was discarded due to its complexity, while the **Be Weatherwise or Otherwise** topic was not discarded but instead the team chose to focus on resolving the data gaps.

The team then concentrated on exploring the impact of: - Rain intensity in specific Singaporean areas - Rising sea levels - Dengue outbreaks - Urban heat islands

Despite data gaps, particularly with dengue data from 2014-2018, the team decided to proceed with the problem statement on rising temperatures, sea levels, and flood risks. The next steps involve further research and refining the project methodology.
