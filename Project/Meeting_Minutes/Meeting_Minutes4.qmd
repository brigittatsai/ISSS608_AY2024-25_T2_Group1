# Minutes of Meeting 2

**Date:** March 7, 2025

**Attendees:** Brigitta Karen Tsai, Enrico Limberg, Hannah

**Agenda:** Finalising Topic and Visual Storyboard

# 1 Meeting Objectives

The objective of our meetings is to review the available topics and identify a suitable problem statement for our project, ensuring that the necessary data is accessible to support our chosen direction.

# 2 Meeting Agenda

1.  Review of Available Topics
2.  Assessment of Data Availability
3.  Formulation of Problem Statement

## 2.1 Review of Available Topics Discussions

-   Brigitta: Examined the first topic, PISA 2022, and determined it was not a suitable choice due to:

    -   The complexity and extensiveness of the dataset, primarily questionnaire based.

    -   The high level of data manipulation and preprocessing required.

    -   **Task**: Brigitta to document key challenges and findings.

    -   **Conclusion**: The team decided to drop this topic.

-   Enrico & Hannah: Explored the second topic, Be Weatherwise or Otherwise, and found challenges due to:

    -   Data being too scattered (recorded on a monthly basis), making it hard to analyze long-term trends.

    -   Climate trends being influenced by multiple external factors not fully captured in the dataset.

    -   Task: Enrico and Hannah to summarize the data gaps and challenges.

## 2.2 Assessment of Data Availability

-   Brigitta and Hannah explored two potential extensions, “Impact of Climate Change on Carbon Emissions” and “Impact of Carbon Emissions on Climate Change”. Both extensions faced data fragmentation issues and lack of comprehensive datasets.

-   Brigitta and Hannah expressed concerns that the Be Weatherwise topic would be overwhelming due to the need for large datasets.

-   Enrico provided a different perspective. He suggested that instead of analyzing all areas, the team could focus on specific key areas based on available data such as dengue fever, coastal areas, and flood-prone regions. This approach would narrow the scope and make the project more manageable, despite the fragmentation in the available datasets.

-   Enrico to explore how to refine the focus based on specific areas. 3. Formulation of Problem Statement

-   Brigitta and Hannah investigated the impact of Changi’s weather data on flight arrivals and departures.

-   Brigitta, Enrico, and Hannah realized it was too much to collect all the flight data, leading to a reconsideration of the topic.

-   Enrico exolored the impact of rain intensity in specific Singapore areas on rising sea levels (coastal impact analysis), Dengue fever outbreaks (potential mosquito breeding correlations), Rising temperatures and urban heat island effects.

-   Brigitta then questioned how to identify the areas with the highest dengue cases.

-   Enrico suggested analyzing dengue fever cases first, then selecting the area for further data collection.

-   Brigitta reviewed available dengue data sources, but only found records from 2014 to 2018.

-   Hannah verified the fact that there is no more recent datas on dengue.

-   Brigitta and Enrico researched flood-prone areas in Singapore to refine focus.

-   Brigitta, Enrico and Hannah chose to focus only on rising temperatures, rising sea levels and flood risks.

-   Enrico drafted initial problem statement.

## 2.3 Formulation of Problem Statement

-   Brigitta reviewed available dengue data sources, but only found records from 2014 to 2018.

-   Hannah verified the fact that there is no more recent datas on dengue. • Brigitta and Enrico researched flood-prone areas in Singapore to refine focus.

-   Brigitta, Enrico and Hannah chose to focus only on rising temperatures, rising sea levels and flood risks.

-   Enrico drafted initial problem statement.

# 3 Follow-up Meeting

**Date**: 13th March 2025

**Objective**: Review progress, share findings, and finalize next steps based on new data collected.

**Agenda**:

-   **Review of Data Collection Progress**

    -   Brigitta & Hannah: Share findings from continued search for datasets on temperature rise and flood risks.

    -   Enrico: Present research findings from news sources and climate-related papers on climate changes in Singapore.

-   **Discussion of New Data and Information**

    -   Team to evaluate the newly gathered data and information.

    -   Analyze the relevance and quality of datasets for the project.

-   **Finalize Next Steps**

    -   Identify any additional data collection needs. o Outline actions for the next phase of the project based on current findings.

# 4 Conclusion

-   During the meetings on 4th and 7th March 2025, the team reviewed various topics and datasets. The PISA 2022 dataset was discarded due to its complexity, while the Be Weatherwise or Otherwise topic was also set aside due to fragmented data. The team then focused on exploring the impact of rain intensity in specific Singaporean areas, addressing rising sea levels, dengue outbreaks, and urban heat islands. Despite data gaps, particularly with dengue data from 2014-2018, the team decided to proceed with the problem statement on rising temperatures, sea levels, and flood risks. The
