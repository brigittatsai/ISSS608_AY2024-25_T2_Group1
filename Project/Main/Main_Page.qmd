# Singapore Weather Demystified: Visualizing Atmospheric Data

## [Project Overview]{.underline}

Weather patterns play a crucial role in shaping various sectors, from government planning to industry operations and public safety. Understanding these patterns is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as aviation, agriculture, energy, transportation, and insurance. Our project aims to analyze and present weather patterns across different regions of Singapore, offering a comprehensive and interactive tool to support users in making data-driven decisions for safety, efficiency, and preparedness.

To achieve this, we have developed a dynamic and user-friendly Shiny App that provides meaningful insights into Singapore’s weather conditions. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, ensuring ease of navigation while maintaining a focus on delivering in-depth analytical capabilities. Through interactive visualizations and real-time data integration, users can explore trends, patterns, and anomalies in Singapore’s weather, gaining valuable insights to enhance their strategic planning and risk management.

By leveraging this tool, meteorologists can refine forecasting models, government agencies can enhance disaster preparedness, and businesses can optimize operations based on weather-related risks. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and insightful platform that empowers users with a deeper understanding of Singapore’s weather dynamics, contributing to smarter decision-making across multiple industries.

### [Analysis Overview]{.underline}

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations like histograms, box and violin plots, and trend charts reveal distribution patterns, central tendencies, outliers, and temporal trends in weather data.
-   **Time Series Analysis & Forecasting**: Analyzes and forecasts changes in rainfall, wind speed, and temperature over time, enabling comparisons across stations and identifying unusual patterns or extreme events.
-   **Geospatial Mapping**: Uses spatial visualization to highlight weather parameter distributions and detect regional extremes, with the ability to filter by area or administrative district for deeper insights.

## [Dataset]{.underline}

The dataset used includes daily records of rainfall, temperature, and wind speed from January to December 2024, obtained from the [*Meteorological Service Singapore*](https://www.weather.gov.sg/home/). For geospatial mapping, two additional datasets were used: the Rainfall Station dataset for station coordinates, and the MPSZ-2019 dataset for URA Master Plan 2019 subzone boundaries.

## [Relevant Works]{.underline}

Several relevant works were explored to enhance the methodology and provide additional inspiration for the analysis. The following is a list of useful references identified:

1.  [Visual Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Data: Applications in Weather Forecasting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280600288_Visual_Analysis_of_Spatio-Temporal_Data_Applications_in_Weather_Forecastinghttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/280600288_Visual_Analysis_of_Spatio-Temporal_Data_Applications_in_Weather_Forecasting)

    This research paper has given us several useful creative methods of visualising weather data. For example, the minimap timeline for weather forecast is an interesting visuals to be presented, showing a short-term weather forecast. The research paper also used curve-pattern analysis to identify historical trends of weathers for the purpose of forecasting future weathers. Although the main topic for this paper is related to weather forecasting, their methods of analysing historical data is a useful resource to refer to.

2.  [A Visual Analytics Pipeline for the Identification and Exploration of Extreme Weather Events from Social Media Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/10/11/174)

    This research paper shows a detailed weather analysis for extreme weather events, which also includes floods and other extreme weather events. This paper utilizes interactive visualisation techniques to improve the quality of weather warnings. Their methods in visualising extreme weather events using geospatial mapping is well-thought, making this a useful resource for our team to learn from this paper. It utilizes different colors and details of the visuals very well for audience to understand the meaning behind the visuals presented.
