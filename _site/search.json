After the overall analysis, we will zoom in to certain areas that have higher frequency of rainfalls, analysing starting from monthly, weekly, to the daily records. In addition, our team will also analyse the intensity level of the rainfall (heavy/ light rains) in these highlighted areas.

However, there are several limitations that we found during the dataset exploration and topic exploration. The weather data provided by Meteorological Service Singapore’s website has several issues. Out of the 63 regions listed, 19 regions do not have weather records at all, and 27 regions have rainfall records, but not temperature data, which could have enhanced our analysis. To tackle this, we will select regions in each administrative district that have complete data. There is also another challenge in this dataset. The website provides monthly records of each region, hence, our team will need to extract the data monthly and merge it during the process. Our team will carefully select and extract the required data accordingly."

For example, the minimap timeline for weather forecast is an interesting visuals to be presented, showing a short-term weather forecast. The research paper also used curve-pattern analysis to identify historical trends of weathers for the purpose of forecasting future weathers. Although the main topic for this paper is related to weather forecasting, their methods of analysing historical data is a useful resource to refer to.\nA Visual Analytics Pipeline for the Identification and Exploration of Extreme Weather Events from Social Media Data\nThis research paper shows a detailed weather analysis for extreme weather events, which also includes floods and other extreme weather events. This paper utilizes interactive visualisation techniques to improve the quality of weather warnings. Their methods in visualising extreme weather events using geospatial mapping is well-thought, making this a useful resource for our team to learn from this paper. It utilizes different colors and details of the visuals very well for audience to understand the meaning behind the visuals presented."

Through the geospatial mapping, we will find out regions with highest frequency of rainfall, highlighting areas that requires extra attention. The storyboard will continue with several time-series analysis, unveiling the weather patterns of different regions and areas in Singapore. After the overall analysis, we will zoom in to certain areas that have higher frequency of rainfalls, analysing starting from monthly, weekly, to the daily records. In addition, our team will also analyse the intensity level of the rainfall (heavy/ light rains) in these highlighted areas. By combining visualisation methods both listed in this proposal and other potential visualisation methods that we might explore during the process, our team will unveil the hidden patterns and cause of weather issues in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\nOur team aims to present as detailed findings as possible through these data visualisations. However, there are several limitations that we found during the dataset exploration and topic exploration. The weather data provided by Meteorological Service Singapore’s website has several issues. Out of the 63 regions listed, 19 regions do not have weather records at all, and 27 regions have rainfall records, but not temperature data, which could have enhanced our analysis. To tackle this, we will select regions in each administrative district that have complete data. There is also another challenge in this dataset. The website provides monthly records of each region, hence, our team will need to extract the data monthly and merge it during the process. Our team will carefully select and extract the required data accordingly.\n\n\n\nOur team has explored some of the relevant works that could improve our methods in our work and to give us more room for exploration ideas in our analysis. The following are list of relevant works that we found useful:\n\nVisual Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Data: Applications in Weather Forecasting\nThis research paper has given us several useful creative methods of visualising weather data. For example, the minimap timeline for weather forecast is an interesting visuals to be presented, showing a short-term weather forecast. The research paper also used curve-pattern analysis to identify historical trends of weathers for the purpose of forecasting future weathers. Although the main topic for this paper is related to weather forecasting, their methods of analysing historical data is a useful resource to refer to.\nA Visual Analytics Pipeline for the Identification and Exploration of Extreme Weather Events from Social Media Data\nThis research paper shows a detailed weather analysis for extreme weather events, which also includes floods and other extreme weather events. This paper utilizes interactive visualisation techniques to improve the quality of weather warnings. Their methods in visualising extreme weather events using geospatial mapping is well-thought, making this a useful resource for our team to learn from this paper. It utilizes different colors and details of the visuals very well for audience to understand the meaning behind the visuals presented."
