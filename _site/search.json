    "text": "Weather patterns play a crucial role in shaping various sectors, from government planning to industry operations and public safety. Understanding these patterns is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as aviation, agriculture, energy, transportation, and insurance. Our project aims to analyze and present weather patterns across different regions of Singapore, offering a comprehensive and interactive tool to support users in making data-driven decisions for safety, efficiency, and preparedness.\nTo achieve this, we have developed a dynamic and user-friendly Shiny App that provides meaningful insights into Singapore’s weather conditions. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, ensuring ease of navigation while maintaining a focus on delivering in-depth analytical capabilities. Through interactive visualizations and real-time data integration, users can explore trends, patterns, and anomalies in Singapore’s weather, gaining valuable insights to enhance their strategic planning and risk management.\nBy leveraging this tool, meteorologists can refine forecasting models, government agencies can enhance disaster preparedness, and businesses can optimize operations based on weather-related risks. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and insightful platform that empowers users with a deeper understanding of Singapore’s weather dynamics, contributing to smarter decision-making across multiple industries.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations like histograms, box and violin plots, and trend charts reveal distribution patterns, central tendencies, outliers, and temporal trends in weather data.\nTime Series Analysis & Forecasting: Analyzes and forecasts changes in rainfall, wind speed, and temperature over time, enabling comparisons across stations and identifying unusual patterns or extreme events.\nGeospatial Mapping: Uses spatial visualization to highlight weather parameter distributions and detect regional extremes, with the ability to filter by area or administrative district for deeper insights.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset used includes daily records of rainfall, temperature, and wind speed from January to December 2024, obtained from the Meteorological Service Singapore. For geospatial mapping, two additional datasets were used: the Rainfall Station dataset for station coordinates, and the MPSZ-2019 dataset for URA Master Plan 2019 subzone boundaries.\n\n\n\nSeveral relevant works were explored to enhance the methodology and provide additional inspiration for the analysis. The following is a list of useful references identified:\n\nVisual Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Data: Applications in Weather Forecasting\nThis research paper has given us several useful creative methods of visualising weather data. For example, the minimap timeline for weather forecast is an interesting visuals to be presented, showing a short-term weather forecast. The research paper also used curve-pattern analysis to identify historical trends of weathers for the purpose of forecasting future weathers. Although the main topic for this paper is related to weather forecasting, their methods of analysing historical data is a useful resource to refer to.\nA Visual Analytics Pipeline for the Identification and Exploration of Extreme Weather Events from Social Media Data\nThis research paper shows a detailed weather analysis for extreme weather events, which also includes floods and other extreme weather events. This paper utilizes interactive visualisation techniques to improve the quality of weather warnings. Their methods in visualising extreme weather events using geospatial mapping is well-thought, making this a useful resource for our team to learn from this paper. It utilizes different colors and details of the visuals very well for audience to understand the meaning behind the visuals presented."

    "text": "In December 29, 2024, Singapore residents were concerned with flash flood, which happened in Bukit Timah area, triggered by heavy rainfall. This flood has brought many people’s attention towards the increasing frequency of rainfall. PUB (Public Utilities Board) highlighted that the Bukit Timah area is prone to flooding, and the drainage system improvement works has been ongoing over the past decade. They have also issued flood risk warnings for nearly 20 location points, including Bukit Timah and Toa Payoh area, as well as western and central areas. This extreme climate change has influenced weather patterns. Singapore faces many challenges managing these weather fluctuations to minimize the impact towards their residents and the landscapes. (source: Channel News Asia)\n\n\n\nAs weather enthusiasts, who have high curiosity on weather changes and impacts towards the daily life of Singapore residents, our team has decided to further deep-dive into weather data, unveiling the pattern of rainfalls and exploring the association between rainfall patterns and flood risks, to avoid potential future floods happening in Singapore. As Singapore is a tropical country, Singapore is iconic for its high humidity, leading to frequent rainfalls. As the climate continue to evolve, understanding the historical rainfall patterns is crucial for either residents’ activities, urban planning and even safeguarding public facilities. Hence, by carefully processing weather data and visualising it, our team aims to develop enhanced Shiny app for several purposes, to raise residents’ awareness towards rainfall periods, carefully planning their activities, and also to support key government decisions influenced by weather conditions."

Our team will begin with geospatial mapping, to see the overall rainfall patterns across Singapore’s regions. Through the geospatial mapping, we will find out regions with highest frequency of rainfall, highlighting areas that requires extra attention. The storyboard will continue with several time-series analysis, unveiling the weather patterns of different regions and areas in Singapore. After the overall analysis, we will zoom in to certain areas that have higher frequency of rainfalls, analysing starting from monthly, weekly, to the daily records. In addition, our team will also analyse the intensity level of the rainfall (heavy/ light rains) in these highlighted areas. By combining visualisation methods both listed in this proposal and other potential visualisation methods that we might explore during the process, our team will unveil the hidden patterns and cause of weather issues in Singapore."

    "text": "Our team aims to present as detailed findings as possible through these data visualisations. However, there are several limitations that we found during the dataset exploration and topic exploration. The weather data provided by Meteorological Service Singapore’s website has several issues. Out of the 63 regions listed, 19 regions do not have weather records at all, and 27 regions have rainfall records, but not temperature data, which could have enhanced our analysis. To tackle this, we will select regions in each administrative district that have complete data. There is also another challenge in this dataset. The website provides monthly records of each region, hence, our team will need to extract the data monthly and merge it during the process. Our team will carefully select and extract the required data accordingly."

    "text": "Weather patterns play a crucial role in shaping various sectors, from government planning to industry operations and public safety. Understanding these patterns is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as aviation, agriculture, energy, transportation, and insurance. Our project aims to analyze and present weather patterns across different regions of Singapore, offering a comprehensive and interactive tool to support users in making data-driven decisions for safety, efficiency, and preparedness.\nTo achieve this, we have developed a dynamic and user-friendly Shiny App that provides meaningful insights into Singapore’s weather conditions. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, ensuring ease of navigation while maintaining a focus on delivering in-depth analytical capabilities. Through interactive visualizations and real-time data integration, users can explore trends, patterns, and anomalies in Singapore’s weather, gaining valuable insights to enhance their strategic planning and risk management.\nBy leveraging this tool, meteorologists can refine forecasting models, government agencies can enhance disaster preparedness, and businesses can optimize operations based on weather-related risks. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and insightful platform that empowers users with a deeper understanding of Singapore’s weather dynamics, contributing to smarter decision-making across multiple industries.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations like histograms, box and violin plots, and trend charts reveal distribution patterns, central tendencies, outliers, and temporal trends in weather data.\nTime Series Analysis & Forecasting: Analyzes and forecasts changes in rainfall, wind speed, and temperature over time, enabling comparisons across stations and identifying unusual patterns or extreme events.\nGeospatial Mapping: Uses spatial visualization to highlight weather parameter distributions and detect regional extremes, with the ability to filter by area or administrative district for deeper insights."

Despite gaps (e.g., dengue data), the team aligned on a feasible problem statement centered on climate impacts—rising temperatures, sea levels, and flood risks in Singapore."
